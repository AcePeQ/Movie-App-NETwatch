      <h2>How to use NETwatch</h2>

      <h3>Is it free?</h3>

      <p>
        It sure is! Everything on NETwatch is completely free to use. But of
        course, some of the streaming services require a subscription or a
        rental fee. To watch free content, we have gathered some free services
        for you to enjoy.
      </p>

      <h3>What should I watch?</h3>

      <p>
        No worries. Our front page is updated daily with play tips, and the
        official Team NETwatch profile is chock full of themed collections.
        Don't forget to follow your friends and other users for even more
        inspiration!
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need a profile to use NETwatch?</h3>
      <p>
        Not at all! But it's much more fun if you do, and you'll be able to
        access even more awesome features, like saving titles, collections,
        following your friends' ratings, and more.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I rate a title?</h3>

      <p>
        First of all, you will need a NETwatch profile. Then find the title you
        want to rate, mark it as seen, and voila! You will now be able to rate
        it from 1-10 stars.
      </p>

      <h2>Movies and Shows</h2>
      <h3>Why can't I find a specific title?</h3>
      <p>
        We continue to update our content, but if a movie/show/documentary
        hasn't been on a streaming service, we might not have it in our system.
        Feel free to write a message here with what is missing and we will get
        right on it.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Why is there no link to a title that I know is available for streaming?
      </h3>

      <p>
        We update our links continuously, but sometimes there might be a glitch
        in the matrix and that's a mistake. Please feel free to write us a
        message about the missing playlinks here.
      </p>

      <h3>
        I want to watch a specific title, but none of my streaming services has
        it. What should I do?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Just save the title and you'll get a notification when it's available
        for streaming. Remember to turn on notifications in the app!
      </p>

      <h2>Houston, we have a problem</h2>

      <h2>Anything else?</h2>
      <h3>I couldn't find an answer to my question in the FAQ?</h3>
      <p>
        Then it must be a really good question! We would love to try and answer
        it for you, if you would just write it to us right here.
